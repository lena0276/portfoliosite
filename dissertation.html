This research project investigates how the public perceives corporations’ performance of their social responsibilities and philanthropic activities in our Digital Society. This research project was completed as an Independent Student Portfolio (ISP) project for my master’s degree from University of Glasgow. This website is designed to educate visitors on public folk theories of corporate social responsibility and philanthropy (CSR/P) in our Digital Society, the academic research process, visual focus groups as a creative research method, and my personal reflections on completing this ISP.

                    Before you begin exploring a couple things you should know. For this project I used the following definitions for corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate philanthropy (CP). 
                    <ul style="font-size: 1vw;">
                        <li>
                            i.	<b> Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):</b> The “context-specific organizational actions and policies that take into account stakeholders’ expectations and the triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental performance” (Aguinis, 2011, as cited in Aguinis and Glavas, 2012). 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ii.	<b>Corporate Philanthropy (CP):</b> The “voluntary and unconditional transfers of cash or other assets by private firms for public purposes” (Gautier and Pache, 2015, p.343)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:1.25vw;">
                    Though existing literature makes a clear argument for the differences between CSR and CP (von Schnurbein, Seele, and Lock, 2016). This project looks at CSR and CP together using the acronym CSR/P (corporate social responsibility and philanthropy). I made this decision to minimize the complexities of CSR and CP for participants and to increase the likelihood of participants folk theories included CSR/P activities in our Digital Society.

                                        Corporate Social Responsibility and Philanthropy (CSR/P) is a highly complex and debated topic across academic disciplines. This research project takes a digital sociological approach investigating the intersection between our digital and social worlds with corporations’ ‘do good’ activities. Existing literature on CSR/P “remains deeply scattered between academic disciplines” (Gautier and Pache, 2015) and rarely includes interdisciplinary conclusions. The number of ongoing scholarly debates reflects the “complexity of the practice and the difficulties for both practitioners and observers to get a solid grasp of” CSR/P (Gautier and Pache, 2015). To minimize the complexities of CSR/P from a researcher and research participants perspective this project uses a big picture understanding of CSR/P in our Digital Society.                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        CSR/P existed before mass digitalization, dating back to business practices of the late-nineteenth century. The history of CSR/P prior to the rise of the internet is important because it demonstrates the role and potential for individuals to drive corporations’ CSR/P activities. Following the social and cultural change brought on by the industrial revolution, early forms of CSR/P began to take hold. CSR/P eventually became what some regard as a “building block of American civilization” (Gautier and Pache, 2015, p.344). Rooted in the social, cultural, and religious practices of benevolence dominating elite circles in the late 19th century (Agudelo, Jóhannsdóttir and Davídsdóttir, 2019) it is unsurprising that businesses integrated charitable initiatives into their business models. These early forms of CSR/P included welfare schemes in the form of creating community and employee programs, donation of monetary gifts, and the development of policies (Agudelo, Jóhannsdóttir and Davídsdóttir, 2019). However, the standardization of CSR/P practices occurred between the 1950s and 2000s partially overlapping with the changes brought on by the development of the internet, the launching of the World Wide Web (WWW), and the rise of the digital economy. CSR/P practices of our Digital Society are influenced by pre and post digitalization. Therefore, requiring the acknowledgment of historic CSR/P giving traditions and business practices as they have the capacity to shape individuals and research participants interpretations of modern CSR/P activities.

                                        To conceptualize individuals’ modern folk theories of CSR/P, CSR/P must first be framed within the context of our Digital Society. Within the field of digital sociology, our Digital Society can be understood as “our present society… society affected by digitally networked communication tools and platforms, such as the internet and social media” (Lindgren 2022, pg. 2). Born out of the “rather unlikely intersection of big science, military research, and libertarian culture” (Castells, 2002, p.17; Lindgren, 2020, p.15) the development of the internet and the launch of the WWW rang in a new digitally driven era. The “digitally networked social reality” created by the internet and the WWW brought with it a “new economic system where everyone could take part” (Lindgren 2022, p.15) – one known as the digital economy. Collectively the internet, WWW, and rise of the digital economy paved a way for new forms of digital gift giving to arise including donations of user data, digital resources, and digital expertise (Elder-Vass, 2016; 2022) transforming corporations CSR/P models. The drastic changes brought on by the transition to a Digital Society positioned CSR/P at the intersection of businesses and our social world. However, within academia little is known about what today’s digital CSR/P models are giving and the public’s perception of these ‘gifts.’

                                        The significance of this project is twofold – the first lies in what was researched (i.e. the research questions), and the second is in how the research was conducted (i.e. the methodology and methods).

                                                <b>The Research Question:</b> Understanding how public perceives corporations’ CSR/P efforts is often absent in academic research. Therefore, this practical project is driven by two guiding questions: How do existing folk theories influence public perception and trust of organizations CSR/P initiatives in the digital society and how does the public conceptualize their role within corporations giving strategies? The first questions seek to uncover internalized thoughts, emotions, and beliefs people have about company’s social responsibilities to ‘benefit society’ and their actual capacity to ‘do good.’ While the second question works to reveal and investigate the changing power structures within the digital gift economy between users and corporations, specifically users’ dual roles as recipients and givers. In attempting to answer these questions the hope is that this project will fill a whole within existing literature while also providing a way to educate a broader public on the implication of CSR/P on their everyday experiences.

                                                <b>Methodology and Methods:</b> Most research conducted on perceived CSR/P is done through quantitative research and traditional methods (see methodology). However, this research project investigates perceived CSR/P using a qualitative research approach and creative methods. The qualitative approach to this project lets me, as the researcher, view each participant as experts on the topic of study and use their words as evidence of their lived experiences. In choosing a creative research method as my investigation tool, I am “not bound by” (Kara, 2020, p.8) my knowledge of existing methods, instead I am given leeway to ethically use creativity to “manipulate and develop theories and methods” (Kara, 2020, p.8). Therefore, this research project utilizes a new form of an innovative method call Visual Focus Groups to collect project data. The use of a qualitative methodology and a new creative research method adds to the significance of this project as not only is the topic being studied, but so is the data collection method.

                                        The research participants for this project were recruited and selected as a representative sample group of a portion of the public. I selected students from the University of Glasgow as my representative sample because of accessibility to them, their diverse demographic, and their position as future, current, or past professionals. As a University of Glasgow master student, myself, I could use my existing relationships and network with peers to recruit and select participants using purposive and snowball sampling. I used various recruitment techniques including reaching out to existing contacts via email, WhatsApp messaging, and social media to identify and recruit potential participants. I provided interested individuals with a brief synopsis of research project, a plain language statement, and a description of how their data would be used included the publication of drawings and quotes to the project website, prior to them agreeing to participate.

                                        I successfully recruited 13 graduate students from the University of Glasgow. Participants were divided into three groups based on their preferred availability and assigned to a workshop session located on the University of Glasgow campus.

                                        This project utilizes a qualitative methodological approach to guide the research process from design to data collection and analysis. Qualitative research relies on “qualitative data [which is] expressed as text” (Grønmo, 2019, p.11) and according to some scholars “only words are capable of describing complexity” (Loseke, 2017, p.30). Qualitative research is grounded in an ontological approach called constructivism where “reality – both physical and social – exits independently of humans” (Loseke, 2017, p.28). Meaning multiple realities exist because “the social world is constantly being constructed through group interactions in meaning making activities” (Hesse-Biber, 2017, p.6). As this project seeks to find meaning through research participants individual experiences and their group interactions, discussions, questionnaire responses, and creative drawings a qualitative approach grounded in a constructivist ontology is a suitable and appropriate philosophical approach for this research.                                     
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The philosophical approach of constructivism and qualitative research supports this projects use of creative research methods. Creative research methods are essentially “creative solutions to research problems” meaning researchers are “not bound by” (Kara, 2020, p.8) their existing knowledge of research methods. Instead, researchers are encouraged to use creativity to “manipulate and develop theories and methods,” (Kara, 2020, p.8). The flexibility allowed by creative research methods enabled the adaption and use of Visual Focus Groups (VFG) as this project’s data collection method. Additionally, creative research methods support the data analysis process enabling the creative use of multimodal and embodied analysis to study the various types of collected data.

                                        The questionnaire asked participants how they believed CSR/P is performed in our Digital Society. Participants selected from a list of different CSR/P strategies that I provided them. Looking at the graph you can see that most participants recognized community programs, ethical business practices, sustainability initiatives, and diversity, equity, and inclusion CSR/P initiatives. While a less than 3 participants marked commercials, data gifts, gifts of resources, and gifts of expertise. This is important because the CSR/P performance methods that only a few participants identified are those most prevalent in our Digital Society. Large technology corporations like Google, Meta, and Microsoft often give user data, digital resources (i.e., devices, software, code), and technological expertise (i.e. training or consultants) as gifts.

                                        I was not surprised that only a few participants identified the predominate CSR/P strategies in our Digital Society. As until I completed extensive review of existing literature, I did not know that user data, digital resources, and technological expertise are key areas of modern CSR/P performance. However, participants who did not check these digital CSR/P initiatives in the questionnaire later acknowledged CSR/P’s use of digital technologies in drawings and discussions. Participants increased understanding of how CSR/P is performed in our digital society over the course of their workshop illustrates the effectiveness of using a creative research method to educate participants.

                                        At the beginning of each workshop participants answered demographic questions as part of the questionnaire. I collected demographic data to inform where participants folk theories came from and provide insights to group dynamics. Three demographic areas stood out to me and helped inform research findings.

                                        <b>Age:</b> When looking for research participants my aim was to recruit ‘digital natives.’ However, as I recruited within my personal network, not all participants ended up meeting the established criteria. As I did not ask interested participants demographic information prior to assigning them to workshops. Consequently, I ended up recruiting participants with birth years ranging from 1979–2000 meaning that not all participants are technically ‘digital natives,’ though all do fit the participant criteria as masters’ students. This was a happy consequence as the diverse age range added great value to my workshop findings.                                    
                                    </p>

                                       <b>Political Affiliation:</b> I asked participants to rank their political affiliation on a scale from 1 (extreme right) to 7 (extreme left) to gain a better understanding of the range of beliefs in the workshop groups. I felt that political affiliation was a good way to understand where participants are coming from when discussing CSR/P as the research topic is inherently political. I do think that asking participants political affiliation served its purpose as participants feedback included a desire to complete the workshop with people of differing beliefs. Which is supported by participants political affiliation responses all being between 4 and 6. This means that there was little diversity in political beliefs in my sample population.                                    
                                    </p>

                                       <b>Nationality:</b> I did not specifically recruit participants with certain nationalities nor seek a sample population that had a diverse range of nationalities. However, due to the international makeup of the University of Glasgow’s graduate students my sample population included people from around the world. This was a happy coincidence, one I would encourage for future research, as participants with diverse nationalities provided a globalized perspective on CSR/P folk Theories. I did not ask participants their nationalities on the questionnaire (though you could), however many self-disclosed this information in workshop discussions and presentations. Many participants cited the diversity in participants experiences as a positive and insightful component of the workshops.

                                        I designed the Linkert-style questions in the questionnaire to establish a baseline of participants CSR/P beliefs at the beginning of the workshop. Individually and collectively the responses to these five questions successfully created a baseline of participants CSR/P folk theories prior to discussing their beliefs and hearing others during the workshop.

                                        One of the key takeaways from these responses is the similarity in participants beliefs. At the end of the workshops several participants indicated an interest in participating in the workshop with people of differing beliefs. In theory a participant group with a diverse range of beliefs would have a broader range of answers to this question.

                                        The creator of drawing NN03 explained their individual drawing as Shell’s (a large multinational corporation) failure to uphold their social responsibility to protect the environment they operated in. The participant spoke emotionally about how the corporation’s destruction of their community has impacted them. Stating that the corporation’s failure to protect their community and environment has impacted the air quality, water quality, and local food sources particularly fish destroying their livelihoods.

                                        Through my review of existing literature, I learned a lot about the different types of digital and in-person campaigns corporations use to perform CSR/P today. Therefore, I was surprised by participants capacity to include different kinds of CSR/P campaigns in their individual drawing. Across the workshops participants conception of CSR/P campaigns included printed advertisements, commercials, in-person donation schemes, diversity, equity, and inclusion marketing strategies, and digital incentive programs. I was surprised not only by the quantity of CSR/P campaigns participants recognized but their ability to discuss them in a reflexive and critical manner. Participants recognized how CSR/P campaigns can manipulate users and consumers to serve corporations’ goals.

                                        Corporations Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives was a recurring theme across data collection workshops. It is not surprising that DEI was a predominate component of participants CSR/P folk theories as it has been an increasingly publicized component of the business world. CSR/P’s DEI initiatives can include anything from greenwashing, rainbow-washing, to equal pay initiatives, and inclusive hiring activities. Participants referenced many of the different DEI initiatives relevant to corporations internal and external activities. Participants spoke of these DEI initiatives with a desire to see improvement. In drawing YJ03 the participant specifically spoke about DEI from a marketing perspective. While the collective drawings in from workshops 1 and 2 talked about DEI in terms of employees.

                                        Workshop 1 depicted their collective folk theories using a mind map. Through participants discussion they identified categories to represent areas of CSR/P they believed could be improved to ‘benefit society.’ At the center of workshop 1’s diagram participants wrote the word ‘Responsibility’ which they defined as “giving back, giving back after you [the corporation] take[s] from the environment or from your community.” This workshop participants believed CSR/P initiatives are inherently apart of corporations’ business practices and as such they need to protect and give back to the communities and environments, they operate in. Workshop 1 identified five categories they believed the social responsibilities of corporations extended to, including: education, cultural change, state regulation and governance, limitation of profits, and taxation.

                                    <p>
                                        Workshop 1’s identification and discussion of their five categories shows participants capacity to grasp complex components of CSR/P. This group had an extensive conversation about their education and cultural change categories. They discussed how education and cultural change could be a solution to their grievances over corporation’s misuse of digital technologies and the for-profit mission driving CSR/P activities. They believed consumer and user education and digital and financial literacy might enable members of the public to be more conscious about how CSR/P activities attempt to manipulate them. Additionally, workshop 1 explored the idea that increase in education and a cultural change could act as a check on corporations’ unregulated power. They hoped this would also give users and consumers more autonomy over how corporations work to ‘benefit society.’                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I found workshop 1’s conclusions very interesting as they illustrated a complex understanding of CSR/P. Workshop 1’s findings incorporated themes of power, digital capitalism, and the absence of governance providing insights to many of my research questions including whether participants folk theories would account for the role of digital technologies. Participants in workshop 1 demonstrated their ability to think reflexively and critically about digital technology’s role in CSR/P through their discussions and drawings. Workshop 1 was extremely successful as participants engagement with the research topic produced high level insights. In workshop 1’s feedback session they shared how they liked how the creative tasks helped them think through their beliefs, and gain a deeper understanding of CSR/P.

                                        Consisting of a collective drawing task and a group discussion, the third and final stage of data collection seeks to establish the groups collective folk theories and critiques of CSR/P in our digital society. Participants are specifically asked to consider how they believe digital technologies play a role in CSR/P today and how they perceive their autonomy in shaping or engaging in CSR/P initiatives. During the collective drawing task, the researcher takes on a moderator role monitoring group members participation and contribution levels. Following the completion of their collective drawing participants presented their poster and are asked follow-up questions.

                                        Workshop 3’s collective drawing is an abstract depiction of the group’s perceptions of CSR/P today. Participants in workshop 3 drew a Pac Man donning corporations logos eating the world to illustrate the unchecked power they believe corporations have today. They believed that corporation’s power is why they have social responsibilities, however, the group remained pessimistic about CSR/P actives potential to do actual ‘good.’ To depict their grievances with corporations’ CSR/P activities today they drew tree with a QR code and shampoo bottles and a gift box with various data forms. Both depictions represent the way corporations use digital technologies to advertise their ‘do good’ initiatives while simultaneously aiming to manipulate or buy consumer loyalty.

                                        This research project investigated the use VFGs for a topic other than activism. Therefore, additional reflection is needed on the expanded use of VFGs as a creative research method. Following the end of each section participants are asked to provide feedback on the workshop and the method. As all participants are masters’ students, they each have received some level of instruction in doing academic research, methodology, and using various data collection methods making them uniquely qualified to provide feedback on the use of this form of VFGs as a data collection method. Participants stated they enjoyed how the workshop gave them the opportunity to share information through multiple methods. Participants said they thought it was “really useful to draw things out” and that “putting your thoughts on paper” aided them in thinking through the complexities of CSR/P. The progression of the workshop from questionnaire to individual drawings to collective drawings worked very well as participants individual folk theories were established prior to the group conversations.                                   
                                    </p>

                                        Based on the research findings and participant feedback there are some recommendations for future research. 
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                I recommend participants are given similar questionnaire at the end of the data collection workshops that they receive at the beginning. This would improve the capacity for the questionnaire to be a baseline for individuals’ folk theories of CSR/P as it would provide researchers with a before and after metric. 
                                            </li>
                                            <p>

                                            </p>
                                            <li>
                                                Participants indicated an interest in a more diverse group of people with differing beliefs and professional experiences. This could be addressed in improving both the recruitment strategy used and implementing a more intensive screening for interested participants prior to putting them into workshop groups. This would entail increasing the diversity in political leanings, education level, and work experience. 
                                            </li>
                                            <p>
                                                
                                            </p>
                                            <li>
                                                The collection of a brief summary of professional experience could increase researchers’ understanding of how individuals’ folk theories are shaped and informed. Additionally, the collection of professional experience could address the possibility of groups facing similar challenges to workshop 3. 
                                            </li>
                                            <p>
                                                
                                            </p>
                                            <li>
                                                I recommend a more intentional integration of research questions into the drawing phases of data collection. I believe this would help focus participants creative outputs and thus the research findings. As this research project has broader aims, objectives, and research question a more focused approach to the creative drawing task is important for future research. 
                                            </li>
                                            <p>
                                                
                                            </p>
                                            <li>
                                                Lastly, the method enabled participants to ask their own question about the research topic inspiring ideas for future research. Some ideas include how public understands their role within the CSR/P use of data gifting, public perception of digital CSR/P ethics, and research unpacking the difference between public folk theories of CSR/P rooted in the should be vs are perspective. 
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>

                                    <p>
                                        These recommendations for future research build upon this project’s establishment of existing folk theories of CSR/P in our digital society enabling countless paths of inquiry to be taken. Overall, the methods success in establishing insights to research questions, while working to educate participants achieved its intended purpose when I selected VFGs for this research project.

                                        When I choose to work with creative research methods and the Visual Focus Group Method I did so because I was challenged to do something different. When I began designing my data collection method, I realized VFGs would help me further develop my facilitation, presentation, and diplomacy skills. To uphold project ethics, I had to ask participant for consent multiple times, and make sure the participants, despite many of them being my friends, were comfortable sharing their data with me and allowing me to put it up on a website. Though I did not find this particularly challenging I did find it uncomfortable because of my closer relationship with some of the participants. Additionally, I noticed throughout the workshops that my facilitation time management skills and waiting for participants to speak before chiming in has improved.                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Outside of the conducting of the workshops, I found the method very intriguing. Not only were participants engaged in what they were doing the whole time, but so was I as the researcher. The conversations participants had illustrated their own learning processes while also enabling me to learn from new perspectives. Additionally, I am curious to see if this type of method could be fruitful for less formal research studies like in organizations looking for feedback or new product brainstorming.

                                        Overall, the skills I developed and learned while using this method are ones that will be invaluable to future projects. And I hope I will be given opportunity to use this type of method in the future.

                                        ‘Folk Theories of CSR/P in our Digital Society’ is the culmination of two years of academic inquiry around how United States cultural institutions could successfully engage visitors through the implementation of immersive technology. 
                                        Like most research projects, questions often lead to more questions prompting the research to take on new approaches, take steps back, change directions, and so on. This project is the outcome of just that – a question that turned into a project, leading to a master’s program, where learning informed a change of direction, uncovering an unknown interest, and thus resulting in a dissertation project on corporate social responsibility and corporate philanthropy (CSR/P). 
                                        I began researching CSR/P this past fall, I was driven by the desire to find a solution to US cultural institutions need for digital resources, specialized expertise, and funding to bring technology to their visitor experiences. However, I discovered CSR/P was a complex academic topic, that simultaneously offered vast amounts of information, but was limited in the specific answers I was looking for. 
                                        Additionally, it quickly became clear I knew very little about CSR/P and how it operated in our Digital Society. 
                                        So, following personal challenge and curiosity I followed a new line of inquiry in hopes of understanding the complexities of CSR/P and what the public believed CSR/P to be in our Digital Society.

                                        Visual Focus Groups (VFG) are an innovative data collection method developed by Dr. Elisabetta Ferrari (project supervisor, University of Glasgow). 
                                        VFGs draw upon graphic elicitation techniques methodology and the traditional focus group method situating a “creative task within a group setting fostering collective conversation” (Ferrari, 2022, p.2). 
                                        The aim of VFGs is to assist research participants in reflexive thinking and thus their expression of unspoken attitudes towards a complex topic. 
                                        As this research project seeks to uncover individuals’ folk theories towards CSR/P, a very complex topic, the hope is that the inclusion of a creative task will enable participants to express underlying thoughts, opinions, and beliefs in a manner that words may not be able to eloquently describe. 
                                        Ferrari’s original design of VFGs included two distinct methods, a diagnostic VFG and a speculative VFG. 
                                        The diagnostic VFG is designed to “help researchers understand how activist [participants] conceptualize their relationship” to the research topic, whereas speculative VFGs are “intended to stimulate participants… critique” of the research topic. 
                                        However, with the support of creative research methods ideology, I utilized my knowledge of both VFG models, in addition to advising from Ferrari to combine both VFG models into one method for the purpose of this project. The intent in combining diagnostic and speculative VFG approach for this project is to gain a more holistic understanding of participants CSR/P folk theories. 
                                        Meaning, through the combination of diagnostic and speculative VFGs I will be able to uncover participants unspoken assumptions and perceptions of CSR/P prior to the influence of group conversation and as the groups folk theories develop collectively throughout the data collection workshops.

                                        Before you learn more about the word cloud above take a second to explore your perceptions of corporate social responsibility and philanthropy. So, close your eyes and ask yourself ‘what are three ways corporations perform or fulfill their social responsibilities to society?’ Write down your thoughts or make a mental note of what crossed your mind. Now look at the word cloud above – are there any similarities or differences? All answers are the right answers here!

The responsibilities of environment, ethical business practices, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and data protection became reoccurring themes throughout the data collection workshops.

                                                This website provides access to project details, data, and reflections from ‘Folk Theories: Corporate Social Responsibility and Philanthropy in our Digital Society’ project. 
                                                The intent behind both the research and this project site is to bring awareness to how corporations preform their social responsibilities and philanthropic endeavors in our digital society.
                                                While seeking to understand how everyday individuals recognize, acknowledge, and grasp the social responsibilities and corresponding actions of corporations.

                                        The questionnaire is designed to establish a preliminary baseline of participants knowledge of CSR/P in the Digital Society through the asking of close ended and multiple-choice questions. 
                                        Upon participants completion of the questionnaire, they are asked to share anything that stood out to them on the questionnaire or any questions they have. 
                                        The intent behind the first phase is to encourage participants to think deeply about how they have experienced CSR/P in their daily lives.

In theory a participant group with different beliefs would have a broader range of answers to this question.

                                        The data collection workshops consist of three phases. 
                                        Following the complete of informed consent procedures, the first phase distributes a questionnaire to participants asking for demographic information and preliminary beliefs and feelings towards CSR/P. 
                                        The second phase is an individual drawing task followed by a brief share-out and discussion. 
                                        Participants are each given a piece of paper, scratch paper, and markers to use. 
                                        The third phase, requires participants to work together to collectively draw agreed upon folk theories of CSR/P. 
                                        During this phase participants were given one poster paper, markers, and ample time to discuss and draw. 
                                        Throughout the three phases of the workshop, I as the primary researcher acted as the facilitator, moderator, and collected field notes. 
                                        The three-phase design for the VFG workshop seeks to encourage participants reflexive and critical thinking starting at an individual level and expanding to collective and collaborative thought. 
                                        The hope is through the three-phase progression the complexities underlying the research topic will be unpacked and explored in drawings and discussions.

                                    <h4>Participants Short Answer Questionnaire Responses</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="modal-body">
                                    <img src="imgs/dissertation/Q_SA_all.png" style="width:80%; position:relative; padding-left: 20%;">
                                    <p>
                                        These pie charts represent participants answers to four short answer questions where participants answered “yes,” “no,” or “I don’t know.” When looking at the diagram it is important to note that not all participants gave the same answer for each question. Meaning that participants who said “no” they are familiar with the concepts of corporate social responsibility and philanthropy are not necessarily the same participants who shade “no” they have not been impacted by CSR/P.                                     
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I find the differences in participants responses to these questions very interesting. As I assumed participants familiarity with CSR/P would go hand and hand with their perception of impact, however, I was wrong. There are many reasons that could exist behind participants differentiation between perceived familiarity and impact of CSR/P. A topic that could be investigated further in future research projects.                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another point of interest in these responses is the difference between participants recognition of technologies’ verses data’s use in CSR/P strategies. Participants saw data as a separate entity from technology when the two go are mutually exclusive. Additionally, the questions about technology and data are asked earlier in the questionnaire then the question asking participants to indicate the way they believed CSR/P strategies are performed. Through the discrepancy in participants beliefs around CSR/Ps use of technology and data I can infer that the questionnaire successfully served its purpose in encouraging participants to think about their preconceived notions of CSR/P.

                                    I designed the Linkert-style questions in the questionnaire to show a range of participants beliefs about CSR/P at the very beginning of the workshop. Individually and collectively the responses to these five questions create a baseline of participants CSR/P folk theories prior to discussing their beliefs and hearing others during the workshop.
