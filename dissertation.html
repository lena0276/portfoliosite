                                        ‘Folk Theories of CSR/P in our Digital Society’ is the culmination of two years of academic inquiry around how United States cultural institutions could successfully engage visitors through the implementation of immersive technology.
                                         Like most research projects, questions often lead to more questions prompting the research to take on new approaches, take steps back, change directions, and so on. This research project is the outcome of just that – a question that turned into a project, leading to a master’s program, where learning informed a change of direction, uncovering an unknown interest, and thus resulting in a dissertation project on CSR/P. When I began research CP in the fall of my master’s program, my hope was I would be able to find a solution to needs of digital resources, specialized expertise, and funding cultural institutions need to bring technology to their visitor experiences, however, I discovered an area of academic inquiry that was simultaneously vast and limited in the specific information I was looking for. 
                                        Additionally, I ran into a tiny little roadblock called: I knew nothing about what CSR/P was and how it operated in our Digital Society. 
                                        So, I decided, if I eventually wanted to find a corporate solution to the cultural sector’s needs, I first needed to understand the behind the scenes of CSR/P.
