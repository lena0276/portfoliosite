                                            Corporate Social Responsibility and Philanthropy (CSR/P) is a highly complex and debated topic across academic disciplines. 
                                        This research project takes a digital sociological approach to investigate the intersection between our digital and social worlds with the social responsibilities of corporations. 
                                        Existing literature on CSR/P “remains deeply scattered between academic disciplines” (Gautier and Pache, 2015) and rarely includes conclusions drawn from interdisciplinary approaches. 
                                        The variety of empirical and conceptual debates reflects the “complexity of the practice and the difficulties for both practitioners and observers to get a solid grasp of” CSR/P (Gautier and Pache, 2015). 
                                        To best negate the complexities of CSR/P from a practitioner’s standpoint this research project relies on a big picture understanding of CSR/P in our digital world; one that integrates the underlying concepts of digital economy, gift giving, data philanthropy, marketing practices, and ethical business practices to name a few. 
                                        While the purpose and significance of this research project lies in understanding “observers” capacity to grasp the complexities of CSR/P based on their own lived experiences. 
                                        This project recognizes individuals’ ability to understand CSR/P by uncovering their preconceived notions, perceptions, opinions, and beliefs - folk theories - of CSR/P.  

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            CSR/P predates mass digitalization, dating back to business practices of the late-nineteenth century. 
                                        The history of CSR/P prior to the rise of the internet is important to recognize as it demonstrates the role and potential for individual autonomy over the social responsibilities and philanthropic activities performed by corporations. 
                                        Following the mass social and cultural change of the industrial revolution early forms of CSR/P began to take hold, eventually becoming what some regard as a “building block of American civilization” (Gautier and Pache, 2015, p.344). Rooted in the social, cultural, and religious practices of benevolence dominating elite circles in the late 19th century (Agudelo, Jóhannsdóttir and Davídsdóttir, 2019) it is unsurprising that businesses integrated charitable initiatives into their business models. 
                                        These early forms of CSR/P included welfare schemes in the form of creating community and employee programs, donation of monetary gifts, and the development of policies (Agudelo, Jóhannsdóttir and Davídsdóttir, 2019). 
                                        However, the standardization of CSR/P practices occurred between the 1950s and 2000s only partially overlapping with the changes brought on by the development of the internet, the launching of the World Wide Web (WWW), and the rise of the digital economy. 
                                        CSR/P practices of our Digital Society are influenced by pre and post digitalization. 
                                        Therefore, requiring the acknowledgment of historic CSR/P giving traditions and business practices as they have the capacity to shape individuals and research participants interpretations of modern CSR/P activities.

                                            To conceptualize individuals’ modern folk theories of CSR/P, CSR/P must first be framed within the context of our Digital Society. 
                                        Within the field of digital sociology, our Digital Society can be understood as “our present society… society affected by digitally networked communication tools and platforms, such as the internet and social media” (Lindgren 2022, pg. 2). 
                                        Born out of the “rather unlikely intersection of big science, military research, and libertarian culture” (Castells, 2002, p.17; Lindgren, 2020, p.15) the development of the internet and the quickly followed launch of the WWW rang in a new digital driven era. 
                                        The “digitally networked social reality” created by the internet and the WWW brought with it a “new economic system where everyone could take part” (Lindgren 2022, p.15) – one known as the digital economy. 
                                        Collectively the internet, WWW, and rise of the digital economy paved a way for new forms of digital gift giving to arise including donations of user data, digital resources, and digital expertise (Elder-Vass, 2016; 2022) transforming corporations CSR/P models. 
                                        The drastic changes brought on by the transition to a Digital Society positioned CSR/P at the intersection of businesses and our social world. 
                                        However, within academia little is known about what today’s digital CSR/P models are giving and the public’s perception of these ‘gifts.’

                                        The academic significance of this project is twofold – the first lies in what is being researched (i.e. the research question), while the second is in how the research was conducted (i.e. the methodology and methods).

                                                <b>The Research Question:</b> Understanding how public perceives the social responsibilities and philanthropic efforts of corporations is often absent in academic research. 
                                                Therefore, this practical project is driven by two guiding questions: How do existing folk theories influence public perception and trust of organizations CSR/P initiatives in the digital society and how does the public conceptualize their role within corporations giving strategies? 
                                                The first questions seek to uncover internalized thoughts, emotions, and beliefs people have about company’s social responsibilities to ‘benefit society’ and their actual capacity to ‘do good.’ 
                                                While the second question works to reveal and investigate the changing power structures within the digital gift economy between users and corporations, specifically users’ dual roles as recipients and givers. 
                                                In attempting to answer these questions the hope is that this project will fill a whole within existing literature while also providing a means to educate a broader public on the implication of CSR/P on their everyday experiences and the lack of governance surrounding corporation’s CSR/P activities.

                                                <b>Methodology and Methods:</b> Most research conducted on perceived CSR/P is done so through quantitative research and traditional methods (see methodology). 
                                                While, this research project investigates perceived CSR/P using a qualitative research approach and creative methods. 
                                                The qualitative approach to this project lets me, as the researcher, view each participant as experts on the topic of study and use their words as evidence of their lived experiences. 
                                                In choosing a creative research method as my tool for investigation, I am “not bound by” (Kara, 2020, p.8) my knowledge of existing methods, however I am given licensure to ethically use creativity to “manipulate and develop theories and methods” (Kara, 2020, p.8). 
                                                Therefore, this research project utilizes a new form of an innovative method call Visual Focus Groups to collect project data. 
                                                The use of a qualitative methodology and a new creative research method adds to significance of the project as not only is the topic being studied, but so is the method used to collect the data.

                                        The research participants for this project were recruited and selected as a representative sample group of a portion of the public. 
                                        I selected students from the University of Glasgow as my representative sample because of accessibility to them, their diverse demographic, and their position as future, current, or past professionals. 
                                        As a University of Glasgow master student, myself, I could use my existing relationships and network with peers to recruit and select participants using purposive and snowball sampling. 
                                        I used various recruitment techniques including reaching out to existing contacts via email, WhatsApp messaging, social media, and flyers on community boards to identify and recruit potential participants. 
                                        I provided interested individuals with a brief synopsis of research project, a plain language statement, and a description of how their data would be used included the publication of drawings and quotes to the project website, prior to them agreeing to participate.

                                        This project utilizes a qualitative methodological approach to guide the research process from design to data collection and data analysis. 
                                        Qualitative research relies on “qualitative data [which is] expressed as text” (Grønmo, 2019, p.11) and according to some scholars “only words are capable of describing complexity” (Loseke, 2017, p.30). 
                                        Qualitative research is grounded in an ontological approach called constructivism where “reality – both physical and social – exits independently of humans” (Loseke, 2017, p.28). 
                                        Meaning multiple realities exist because “the social world is constantly being constructed through group interactions in meaning making activities” (Hesse-Biber, 2017, p.6). 
                                        As this project seeks to find meaning through research participants individual experiences and their group interactions, discussions, questionnaire responses, and creative drawings a qualitative approach grounded in a constructivist ontology is an suitable and appropriate philosophical approach for this research. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The philosophical approach of constructivism and qualitative research supports the use of creative research methods for this research project. 
                                        Creative research methods are essentially “creative solutions to research problems” meaning researchers are “not bound by” (Kara, 2020, p.8) their existing knowledge of research methods. 
                                        Instead, researchers are encouraged to use creativity to “manipulate and develop theories and methods,” (Kara, 2020, p.8). 
                                        The licensure allowed within creative research methods enabled the adaption and use of Visual Focus Groups (VFG) as the data collection method. 
                                        Additionally, creative research methods support the data analysis process enabling the creative use of multimodal discourse analysis to study the collected data regardless of type.

                                        The questionnaire asked participants about the ways they believed corporate social responsibility and philanthropy (CSR/P) is performed in our Digital Society. Participants were provided a list of different CSR/P strategies corporations used to pick from. This diagram represents all participants responses to this question.                                     
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In looking at the graph you can see that most participants recognized community programs, ethical business practices, sustainability initiatives, and diversity, equity, and inclusion CSR/P initiatives. While a maximum of 2 participants marked commercials, data gifts, gifts of resources, and gifts of expertise. This differentiation is important as the CSR/P performance methods that only a few participants identified are those most prevalent in our Digital Society. Large technology corporations like Google, Meta, and Microsoft often give user data, digital resources (i.e., devices, software, code), and technological expertise (i.e. training or consultants) as gifts.

                                    <p>
                                        The fact that only a few participants identified the predominate CSR/P strategies in our Digital Society was not surprising. As until I completed extensive review of existing literature, I did not know that user data, digital resources, and technological expertise are key areas of modern CSR/P performance. However, participants who did not check these digital CSR/P initiatives in the questionnaire did so later in the drawing phases of the workshops. The ability for participants to expand their understanding of how CSR/P is performed in our digital society over the course of a 2.5-hour workshop illustrates how using the creative method worked to educate participants.

                                    I designed the Linkert-style questions in the questionnaire to show a range of participants beliefs about CSR/P at the very beginning of the workshop. Individually and collectively the responses to these five questions create a baseline of participants CSR/P folk theories prior to discussing their beliefs and hearing others during the workshop.

At the end of the workshops several participants indicated an interest in participating in the workshop with people of differing beliefs. In theory a participant group with different beliefs would have a broader range of answers to this question.

                                    I designed the Linkert-style questions in the questionnaire to show a range of participants beliefs about CSR/P at the very beginning of the workshop. Individually and collectively the responses to these five questions create a baseline of participants CSR/P folk theories prior to discussing their beliefs and hearing others during the workshop.

In theory a participant group with different beliefs would have a broader range of answers to this question.

                                        ‘Folk Theories of CSR/P in our Digital Society’ is the culmination of two years of academic inquiry around how United States cultural institutions could successfully engage visitors through the implementation of immersive technology. 
                                        Like most research projects, questions often lead to more questions prompting the research to take on new approaches, take steps back, change directions, and so on. This project is the outcome of just that – a question that turned into a project, leading to a master’s program, where learning informed a change of direction, uncovering an unknown interest, and thus resulting in a dissertation project on corporate social responsibility and corporate philanthropy (CSR/P). 
                                        I began researching CSR/P this past fall, I was driven by the desire to find a solution to US cultural institutions need for digital resources, specialized expertise, and funding to bring technology to their visitor experiences. However, I discovered CSR/P was a complex academic topic, that simultaneously offered vast amounts of information, but was limited in the specific answers I was looking for. 
                                        Additionally, it quickly became clear I knew very little about CSR/P and how it operated in our Digital Society. 
                                        So, following personal challenge and curiosity I followed a new line of inquiry in hopes of understanding the complexities of CSR/P and what the public believed CSR/P to be in our Digital Society.

                                        Visual Focus Groups (VFG) are an innovative data collection method developed by Dr. Elisabetta Ferrari (project supervisor, University of Glasgow). 
                                        VFGs draw upon graphic elicitation techniques methodology and the traditional focus group method situating a “creative task within a group setting fostering collective conversation” (Ferrari, 2022, p.2). 
                                        The aim of VFGs is to assist research participants in reflexive thinking and thus their expression of unspoken attitudes towards a complex topic. 
                                        As this research project seeks to uncover individuals’ folk theories towards CSR/P, a very complex topic, the hope is that the inclusion of a creative task will enable participants to express underlying thoughts, opinions, and beliefs in a manner that words may not be able to eloquently describe. 
                                        Ferrari’s original design of VFGs included two distinct methods, a diagnostic VFG and a speculative VFG. 
                                        The diagnostic VFG is designed to “help researchers understand how activist [participants] conceptualize their relationship” to the research topic, whereas speculative VFGs are “intended to stimulate participants… critique” of the research topic. 
                                        However, with the support of creative research methods ideology, I utilized my knowledge of both VFG models, in addition to advising from Ferrari to combine both VFG models into one method for the purpose of this project. The intent in combining diagnostic and speculative VFG approach for this project is to gain a more holistic understanding of participants CSR/P folk theories. 
                                        Meaning, through the combination of diagnostic and speculative VFGs I will be able to uncover participants unspoken assumptions and perceptions of CSR/P prior to the influence of group conversation and as the groups folk theories develop collectively throughout the data collection workshops.

                                        Before you learn more about the word cloud above take a second to explore your perceptions of corporate social responsibility and philanthropy. So, close your eyes and ask yourself ‘what are three ways corporations perform or fulfill their social responsibilities to society?’ Write down your thoughts or make a mental note of what crossed your mind. Now look at the word cloud above – are there any similarities or differences? All answers are the right answers here! 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The words you may have thought of or those represented in the word cloud represent the ways everyday people perceive the social responsibilities of corporations. The responsibilities of environment, ethical business practices, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and data protection became reoccurring themes throughout the data collection workshops.

                                        The questionnaire is designed to establish a preliminary baseline of participants knowledge of CSR/P in the Digital Society through the asking of close ended and multiple-choice questions. 
                                        Upon participants completion of the questionnaire, they are asked to share anything that stood out to them on the questionnaire or any questions they have. 
                                        The intent behind the first phase is to encourage participants to think deeply about how they have experienced CSR/P in their daily lives.

Individually and collectively the responses to these five questions create a baseline of participants CSR/P folk theories prior to discussing their beliefs and hearing others during the workshop.

However, distinctions between CSR and CP vary among corporations and within academic literature challenging both experts and everyday individuals’ ability to recognize them as exclusive entities. As such, this project will refer to Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Philanthropy (CSR/P) as a collective concept.

                                        The data collection workshops consist of three phases. 
                                        Following the complete of informed consent procedures, the first phase distributes a questionnaire to participants asking for demographic information and preliminary beliefs and feelings towards CSR/P. 
                                        The second phase is an individual drawing task followed by a brief share-out and discussion. 
                                        Participants are each given a piece of paper, scratch paper, and markers to use. 
                                        The third phase, requires participants to work together to collectively draw agreed upon folk theories of CSR/P. 
                                        During this phase participants were given one poster paper, markers, and ample time to discuss and draw. 
                                        Throughout the three phases of the workshop, I as the primary researcher acted as the facilitator, moderator, and collected field notes. 
                                        The three-phase design for the VFG workshop seeks to encourage participants reflexive and critical thinking starting at an individual level and expanding to collective and collaborative thought. 
                                        The hope is through the three-phase progression the complexities underlying the research topic will be unpacked and explored in drawings and discussions.

                                </div>
                                <div class="modal-body">
                                    <img src="imgs/dissertation/Q_SA_all.png" style="width:80%; position:relative; padding-left: 20%;">
                                    <p>
                                        These pie charts represent participants answers to four short answer questions where participants answered “yes,” “no,” or “I don’t know.” When looking at the diagram it is important to note that not all participants gave the same answer for each question. Meaning that participants who said “no” they are familiar with the concepts of corporate social responsibility and philanthropy are not necessarily the same participants who shade “no” they have not been impacted by CSR/P.                                     
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I find the differences in participants responses to these questions very interesting. As I assumed participants familiarity with CSR/P would go hand and hand with their perception of impact, however, I was wrong. There are many reasons that could exist behind participants differentiation between perceived familiarity and impact of CSR/P. A topic that could be investigated further in future research projects.                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another point of interest in these responses is the difference between participants recognition of technologies’ verses data’s use in CSR/P strategies. Participants saw data as a separate entity from technology when the two go are mutually exclusive. Additionally, the questions about technology and data are asked earlier in the questionnaire then the question asking participants to indicate the way they believed CSR/P strategies are performed. Through the discrepancy in participants beliefs around CSR/Ps use of technology and data I can infer that the questionnaire successfully served its purpose in encouraging participants to think about their preconceived notions of CSR/P.
